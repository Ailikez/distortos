config ARCHITECTURE_ARMV7_M_MAIN_STACK_SIZE
	int "Interrupt stack size, bytes"
	range 8 4294967295
	default 2048
	help
		Size (in bytes) of "main" stack used by core exceptions and interrupts
		in Handler mode.

config ARCHITECTURE_ARMV7_M_KERNEL_BASEPRI
	int "BASEPRI value used in critical sections"
	range 1 15
	default 8
	help
		Minimal numerical priority (inclusive) of interrupt handlers that can
		use system's functions.

		During critical sections all interrupts with numeric priority above or
		equal to this value will be disabled. Interrupts with numeric priority
		below this value are never disabled, but they may not use any system's
		functions.

		Note - "lower" logical priority has "higher" numeric value!
